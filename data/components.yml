  slogan: Purpose Driven. 1st Principles Thinker. Founder. Engineer. Constant Learner. A person who embodies Gary Vaynerchuk's philosophy of "Give, Give, Give, Then Ask." Who strongly believes our only competition is our mental, physical, & spiritual health, not anyone else. He can be found cycling, picking up heavy things at the gym, hiking, reading, or hands on the keys. Being a quality-focused creative craftsman is part of his DNA. The rest can be found tattooed on his body.
