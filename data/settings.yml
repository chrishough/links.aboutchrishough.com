slogan:
  description: 1st Principles Thinker. Founder. Engineer. Storyteller. A quality-focused craftsman with an abundance mindset. Who strongly believes our only competition is our mental, physical, & spiritual health, never anyone else.  When his hands are off the keys, find him lifting iron at the gym, cycling on the road or a mountain downhill, or running through numerous type 2 activities! The rest can be found tattooed on his body.

  description: Chris has been a digital nomad for over eighteen years and counting. His inner child loves adventures and exploring communities through foodie experiences.  If you asked his therapist about him, she would say he's beyond grateful for where he's at and appreciative of what he has, but will never be complacent.  Constant learning, excelling at his passions, and living a full life is part of his DNA.
